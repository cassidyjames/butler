Hybrid native + web app for Home Assistant. Butler wraps your Home Assistant dashboard up in a native UI, integrating better with your OS. Native features include:

- Icon in your App Grid, Applications Menu, Dash, Dock, etc.
- Native header bar
- Save and restore current view and size when closed and re-opened
- Two-finger swipe and mouse button support to go back/forward between views
- Cross-desktop light/dark style support for GNOME, elementary OS, etc.

Other features include:

- Pinch-to-zoom
- Set the scaling with Ctrl+Plus/Minus or Ctrl+0 to reset

## Why not a web browser or PWA?

I don't love the state of web apps and PWAs on Linux; I prefer GNOME Web or Firefox, but the former doesn't truly support PWAs (just web apps with not-that-lightweight of a UI) and the latter doesn't support PWAs on the desktop at all. So, I made this dumb little web wrapper to give myself a bit more integrated of an experience.

If there's more interest in making this into a better-integrated companion app for Linux, I welcome contributions!
